# Phase-3 Project Pokemon CLI
## Introduction:
This CLI was created for Pokemon card collectors who are looking for a place to store information about their collection. This CLI is built upon three related tables, Player, Card, Deck. The Player table is used to store information about the user. Information such as, the users playing level, specific id to access the user and the user's username. The Card table stores information about the card's name, who the card belongs to, the HP, and the type of Pokemon on the card. Lastly, the Deck table stores information such as, the name of the deck and who the deck belongs to.

## Seeding the File:
After forking and cloning the file, the first thing you need to do is run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies.
